# 📊 Expresso Churn Prediction Challenge

This project aims to predict customer churn using the **Expresso Telecom** dataset from Zindi. The solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training with a `RandomForestClassifier`, evaluation, and deployment using a **Streamlit web app**.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their usage behavior, subscription type, and demographic information.
